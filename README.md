# Blockchain prototype

I was inspired by the following [repository] (https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x.git)

For development, I am following the instructions on this [page] (https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46)

I hope to finish the project and increase my knowledge in this field and find a way to implement this technology in my daily work.
